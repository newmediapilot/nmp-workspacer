# Script Progress Log

- **Initial Setup and Workflow Discussion**
  - Discussed how to add workspaces dynamically to the root `package.json` by reading all subdirectories from `packages/`.
  - Defined the objective to restart the script after modifying `package.json` to add workspaces.

- **Imported Required Modules**
  - Introduced `https`, `fs`, `path`, `child_process`, and `chalk` modules to handle HTTP requests, filesystem manipulations, and logging.

- **Check and Add Workspaces to `package.json`**
  - Created `checkAndAddWorkspaces` function to verify if `"workspaces"` field exists in the root `package.json`.
  - If missing, added `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` and restarted the script using `execSync` to apply the changes.

- **Log and Add Workspaces Dynamically**
  - Implemented a `getPackageFolders` function to collect all subdirectory paths inside `packages/` and dynamically add them to the `"workspaces"` field.
  - Log was added for each step, including checking if workspaces exist and adding them if necessary.

- **Ensured Correct Use of `https` for Fetching GitHub Repositories**
  - Introduced a bug fix for the missing `https` module by ensuring that itâ€™s imported correctly at the start of the script.
  - Verified the `https` module by adding console logs for debugging.

- **Adding Commands to Package.json**
  - Implemented functionality to add custom commands (e.g., `build`, `test`, `deploy`) into each repository's `package.json` under `scripts`.
  - Logs were added for each repository, indicating the success or failure of adding commands.

- **Handling Missing `package.json` Files in Repositories**
  - Implemented functionality to check if any repositories lack a `package.json` file, then prompt the user to create one if needed.
  - Introduced a delay (`delay(2000)`) after `npm init -y` to ensure the file creation is completed properly.

- **Cloning Repositories**
  - Added functionality to clone selected repositories from GitHub into the `packages/` directory.
  - Implemented logic to check if the repository already exists and run `git fetch && git pull` instead of cloning again.

- **User Interaction for GitHub Username and Repository Selection**
  - Added prompts to ask for the GitHub username (with default fallback) and let the user select repositories to use.
  - Incorporated a multi-select prompt to choose which repositories to clone and work with.

- **Restart Script After Modifying `package.json`**
  - Integrated logic to restart the script after modifying the root `package.json` to add the `"workspaces"` field.
  - Restart ensures that the new workspaces configuration is applied before proceeding further.

- **Added Prefix Prompt**
  - Implemented a prompt asking the user for a custom prefix for commands (e.g., `myrepo:build`).
  - Used the prefix when adding commands to both the root `package.json` and each package's `package.json`.

- **Final Logging and Results**
  - Logged all major steps with timestamps, including success or error messages for cloning, command additions, and package.json modifications.
  - Final log steps were added to confirm the successful completion of all operations.

- **Fix for `https is not defined` Error**
  - Fixed the error where `https` was not recognized by ensuring that the `https` module is imported at the start.
  - Added a debug console log to verify that `https` is correctly available and functional in the environment.

- **Added Workspaces Dynamically from `packages/`**
  - Instead of hardcoding `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`, implemented logic to dynamically add each subdirectory inside `packages/` as a workspace.
  - This allowed repositories to be added to the workspace dynamically based on the folders found under `packages/`.
